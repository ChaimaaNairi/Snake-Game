# Snake-Game
This is a simple implementation of the classic Snake game using JavaScript. The game is built using HTML5 canvas for rendering and JavaScript for game logic.</br>

The goal of the game is to control the snake to eat as many food as possible without running into any obstacles, such as walls or the snake's own body.</br>
Use the arrow keys on your keyboard to move the snake in the desired direction. The snake will automatically move in the direction it is facing, and will continue in that direction until a new direction is chosen.</br>
Each time the snake eats a piece of food, it will grow in length, making it more difficult to navigate without running into its own body. The game ends when the snake runs into a wall or its own body.</br>
